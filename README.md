## Introduction 📜
Romance & Intimacy On The Rim is a RimWorld mod that adds compatibility between two well known liked mods: Romance On The Rim & Intimacy - a Loving Expansion.

This mod was made because the creators do not wish to add compatibility for the other, and I am a fellow person who has way too much time on their hands and loves using both :3

## Additions ➕
- Intimacy bar is filled appropriately whenever certain actions from Romance On The Rim occur. For example, if two pawns kiss or one plays a song for the other, their intimacy bar goes up.
- Romance bar is filled appropriately whenever certain actions from Intimacy - a Loving Expansion occur. For example, after lovin', the romance bar between two pawns may fill up if they are together.
- Low intimacy will make partners more likely to trigger romantic actions with one another. That way, partners don't just feel lonely!

If there are any issues I have missed, please let me know and I will patch them!

## FAQ ❓
- Is this compatible with X mod?
    - If Romance On The Rim & Intimacy - A Lovin' Expansion are compatible with the mod you're asking about, then this mod will certainly work with that mod. All this mod does is add compatibility, it does not add any extra content or fancy mechanics.
- Does this mod add anything special
  - Apart from integrating the two mods together, no this mod does not add anything else.
- Does this mod work by itself?
  - The sole purpose of this mod is to add integrations between ROTR & Intimacy. There is no reason to add this mod by itself otherwise.
- Why not merge the Intimacy and Romance bar together?
  - The two bars are conceptually different. Intimacy is between the pawn and everyone else, e.g. social interaction. Romance is between the pawn and their partners. For example, a pawn without their partner would have their romance bar low, but have a high intimacy as long as they are around other pawns.
  - I might add a configuration option in the future to combine the two, but for now, this is not planned.
