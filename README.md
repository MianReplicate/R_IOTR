## Introduction 📜
Romance & Intimacy On The Rim is a RimWorld mod that adds compatibility between two well known liked mods: Romance On The Rim & Intimacy - a Loving Expansion.

This mod was made because the creators do not wish to add compatibility for the other, and I am a fellow person who has way too much time on their hands and loves using both :3

## Additions ➕
- Intimacy bar is filled appropriately whenever certain actions from Romance On The Rim occur.
- Romance bar is filled appropriately whenever certain actions from Intimacy - a Loving Expansion occur.
